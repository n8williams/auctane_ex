NOTE: The `user_api_key.txt` file is used to store a user's api key for actions taken with the remote services. The `priv` folder is sort of arbitrarily used here, based on the following description of the `priv` folder, in the context of Phoenix applications:

> "... a directory that keeps all assets that are necessary in production but are not directly part of your source code. You typically keep database scripts, translation files, and more in here"
